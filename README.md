Material of video WinPython-4: How to Create an Image Digitizer Using Winpython

In this video, we see how to program an image digitizer using Winpython and Pygame library. The image digitizer allows us to get the value of the points from a datasheet characteristic. This is very useful in reverse engineering problems where we want to get data from a graphical representation. An example to show how to get the data points from a MOSFET parasitic capacitance versus voltage characteristic is presented.
